Blockchain based voting system 

The Voting system can be fraudulent and wrong.  In past, many electronic election systems (or e-voting systems) failed because they were not able to guarantee the total security respect to the vote privacy protection, especially in the long-medium term and in the cases of brute force attacks. Hence the EVMs or Electronic Voting Machines used for voting in most of the countries aren’t as safe as we think they are, the main reasons for which are:
1. Lack of consistency of data between EVMs and voter sheets 
2. No distinction between a ‘malfunction’ (which suggests a technical defect) and ‘tampering’ (manipulation aimed at fraud).
3. Lack of transparency, verifiability, and secrecy.

This idea was inspired from the research paper “Crypto-voting, a Blockchain based e-Voting System” written by Francesco Fusco. The paper stated that, in most of the electing contexts, the secrecy is mandatory except in the phase of signatures collection which, by nature, are publicly available.

We thus aim on using blockchain technology to integrate the management procedures of the phases and events of an election. These events include the set-up of the system, the distribution of credentials, the voting, the collection of ballot papers, the counting of preferences, the publication of results, and so on. In addition, our system aims to improve the methods of traceability and audit about voting operations, with no middleman.

So with Azure Blockchain Services, we aim to build an application that will ensure free and fair elections. In the basic version of the application, we aim will begin with the following:-
1. Better filtering of the users based on age, gender etc.
2. Ensuring one person can vote only once in an election.
3. Maintaining the anonymity and secrecy of the voters and their casted votes.
4. Decentralization of the whole voting process, which means that there is no need of a central agency which must be trusted to conduct      the elections fairly and securely.

The implementation of this application, can be related to that of cryptocurrencies, just that casting votes should be seen as entering transactions. This way, we can create a blockchain which keeps track of the tally of the votes and everyone can agree on the final count because they can count the votes themselves, and because of the blockchain audit trail, they can verify that no votes were changed or removed, and no illegitimate votes were added.
